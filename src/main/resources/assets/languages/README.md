# How to contribute to Translating

- Get into contact with Kodehawa#3457 on Discord to get started

  + Tell him which language you want to contribute to
  + Afterwards he'll set you up on the server, so that you've access to #contributors
  + He'll also add you to your language on crowdin
    + Or set the language up, in case it isn't present yet

## Guide:
   + Keep the overall feeling of the bot consistent with the english version.
   + Keep the translation clean.
   + Don't remove or "translate" anything remotely like %1$s, %2$s or %\<number\>$s.
   + Don't change the formatting marks (\*\*, \*, etc). If a word is \*\*like this\*\* translate it \*\*como esto\*\*, for example.
   + We're going to review translation files before going to production, so no worries if something happens to go wrong we will point it out and assist you.
   + If you're unsure what a parameter is, you can try using the command or ask in #contributors.
   + For languages that are read backwards (compared to english), the %\<number\>$s-alike parameters can be moved to accommodate your language reading. You can ask in #contributors if you're lost.


# To have in mind
If you can't DM Kodehawa, add them as a friend. Please ping them in Mantaro Hub before adding, so he knows who you are. 

Thank you.

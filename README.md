        <h2>Konachan notice (net.kodehawa.lib.imageboard.konachan)</h2>
        <p>That package is a port of the <a href="https://github.com/Mxrck/KonachanLib"><b>original konachan library</b></a> to Java 8 and to better suit our needs. I just didn't want to post it on GitHub as a separate lib, but if anyone wants I'll do so.</p>
